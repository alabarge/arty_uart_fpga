1.    from the ip\script directory: double-click create_fpga.bat to create a vivado
      project to synthesize and simulate this IP, it will delete any existing vivado folder.
2.    synthesize design
3.    from the vivado project, source ../script/create_ip.tcl in order to package the IP.

4.    simulation with modelsim requires that vivado build the xilinx libraries using modelsim,
      if you're using the intel version of modelsim then copy the entire directory and
      use the copy for xilinx, copy C:/intelFPGA/modelsim_ae C:/intelFPGA/modelsim_xe
      Tools->Compile Simualation Libraries ... (choose desired family, this takes about 1.5 hours)
      compiled libarary location : C:/intelFPGA/modelsim_xe/xilinx_compiled/2022.2
      simulator executable path : C:/intelFPGA/modelsim_xe/win32aloem
5.    as an example, launch modelsim and open uart\tesbench\uart_TB.mpf
6.    at the command line in modelsim : do run.do
